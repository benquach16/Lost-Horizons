Lost Horizons - Space Game
==========================

Written by Ben Quach and Derek Lee

This is a rewrite of a project that pretty much flopped due to inexperience in programming.
For the latest source code, see [our github page][losthorizons-repo]. You may also take a look at the [old project][losthorizons-old].

The rundown of this game is that it is a 3D space RPG with RTS elements. You control a spaceship that you can customize and command a fleet
in order to complete missions.
