Lost Horizons - Space Game
==========================

Written by Ben Quach and Derek Lee
This is a rewrite of a project that pretty much flopped due to inexperience in programming.
For the latest source code, see [our github page][losthorizons-repo]. You may also take a look at the [old project][losthorizons-old].

Building for Windows
--------------------

This project uses [Irrlicht Engine 1.8][irrlicht]. Place it in the root of your C drive.
Just open the solution using Visual Studio 2012 and build it.
